You can also customize your own drink! Not only do they have tasty juices, but they also have acai bowls which are to die for. While you wait they have board games layed out on every table as well as a well decorated backyard to take pictures in.</p>

She always knows where to go when it comes to eating and seem to find the cutest places ever! I've only been here once, but it was enough time for this place to steal my heart. The empanadas are made fresh and taste really good. They also have such delicious baked goods (themed ones too when it comes to holidays).</p>

Sophmore year I decided to join the track team at NEST + m and I made such good memories here. It was always so much fun before events when we would go down and warm up together as a team. My favorite event is the relay race. I was also able to see my old school compete at this same place, it was so much fun catching up! I personally enjoyed going to starbucks after a day of running LOL. </p>

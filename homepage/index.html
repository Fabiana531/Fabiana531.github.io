    <h1>The Love of Something Ugly</h1>
    <div id="text" class="text">
      <p1>To truly know a place, to know how crisp the air smells on the first day of fall, to know what deli makes the most delicious sandwiches, to understand the inner character of a stranger just by taking one glance at them, a person has to observe the place carefully. For people to come here and say that their experience in New York was the worst of all means they never stayed long enough to figure out what it truly is. It is not a place that someone adjusts to easily: speaking the lingo, holding the train door for someone when they are running towards a departing train, keeping to oneself after a small interaction with a stranger. From afar, yes, the city is beautiful - tall perfectly designed buildings towering over each other - but look down and see the city that New Yorkers know and love. There’s dried up gum covered in dirt from the bottom of people’s shoes and trash overflowing from the corner trash bin that seems to never get emptied. Most strangers think that the city is this wonderful place filled with opportunities and it is, but to be able to grasp those opportunities, whether it be a home away from home or even a sense of self, they have to be found. One might think these discoveries would be somewhere in the skyline, but I found it underground, on the A-train.
        <br><br></p1>
        </div>
      <div id="text" class="text"><p2>  With just one train, a person can visit numerous neighborhoods, explore different environments, and meet a countless number of people; with all of those put together, they form new memories that stay with forever. For many people, New York does just this; it did that for me. As a child growing up moving around New York, I did not know much about what being a “New Yorker” was. I switched schools more than I can count one on hand. I went from switching schools three times in Queens to moving to Long Island (switching schools over there some more), then back to Queens, and finally my high school, NEST + m, in the city. As a child with fairly strict parents, I was not allowed to take the train by myself or even walk down the block to get something to eat from the deli; it wasn’t until I started high school that I got to do all those things. No one was there with me on the train; it was just me, my music, and my thoughts. I’ve always been very observant and cautious, so on my first train ride alone, I observed the people: figured out where they were going, who they were with (whether a boyfriend, girlfriend, friend, family member or someone they met just there). The A-train has helped develop the person that I am today. It holds the memories of my childhood (when I would go on short trips to the city with my family), it holds my present, and I will make sure it’s in my future. The train has given me so much when I needed it to; for me, it was an outlet.
        <br><br></p2>
        </div>
      <div id="text" class="text"><p3>There is something about the train’s motion, moving back and forth, the sound of the tracks overpowering any other sound;  it gives me a break from reality and that is the most relaxing feeling ever. You would think maybe people would stare, think that I’m odd for falling asleep on the train, but they don’t. The A-train is a place where I can feel comfortable; I don’t know any of these people, probably won’t ever see them again; that feeling in itself is the best. They know this happens; it's normal for them too. The way that I can express myself on the train, I can’t do at home. I don’t want my family members to ask me why I am sad, heck sometimes I don’t even know; I need a place to let it all out sometimes, and that is this train. One day I had a horrible day in school; I had fought with someone I cared about. While sitting on the train listening to music, I sat there looking out the window leaning my head against the wall of the train, hearing the whistle, hearing the conductor name the stops; my music slightly overpowering the outside noise,  I just started to close my eyes. When I was a few minutes away from my stop, I opened my eyes; I knew right then that my friend and I were not good for each other: slowly tears started running down my face, getting faster every time, my breathing started to get heavy. I was shaking: devastated because I knew what came next: I had to find some way to tell them how I felt and make them understand. Nobody stared at me how I thought they would; the attention I did not want was granted to me. Everyone just went about their day without judging me and at that moment I knew that this was my home away from home.

      <div id="text" class="text"><p4>Some people think New York City trains are very disgusting and they aren’t wrong. Rats are crawling on the tracks, dried up urine on the walls and floors, homeless people sleeping on a bench (sometimes on the train itself); from this, one can tell the smell isn’t great either. This is true for people who don’t appreciate the little things in life or to tourists who are just here for the week. To them, the subway just serves the same purpose as a car or bus. Not all of New York is a big beautiful piece of scenery; there is garbage on its streets, homeless people are sleeping on the ground almost everywhere, there is vomit on the floor; New York trains have it all. People can compare it to train stations worldwide and say that it is the ugliest, smelliest, dirtiest of all, but there’s more to it than its hideous appearance. It’s special. No one talks about other train stations or subway systems the way people talk about this one; it gives people a feeling of comfort, of belonging to something bigger, being a true New Yorker. Getting used to its smell, looks, and horrible train delays are what make people feel like they truly belong here; everyone knows that only they can deal with how bad the subway system is. Yes, it may not seem like the best feeling in the whole world, but it offers so much: belonging to a great community (the city that never sleeps), having a safe space in the most bizarre places, running into interesting people; it’s all about the objective. If a person comes to New York with their glass half empty, they’ll hate it immediately, but if they come with their glass half full they’ll have the patience to love it.
